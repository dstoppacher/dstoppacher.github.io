<blockquote><tt><b>Summary:</b> We calculate the shared particle fractions of direct progenitor halos after crossmatching all halos and progenitors from the original dark matter simulation (run with Rockstar) and their merger trees output (from Consistent-Trees).</tt></blockquote>

### Detection of phantom halos
