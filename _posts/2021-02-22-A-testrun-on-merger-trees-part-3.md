This is the continuation of the post from <a href="https://dstoppacher.github.io/A-testrun-on-merger-trees/">2021-01-21</a>. The following questions are still open will be discussed in this post.

  <figcaption>Fraction of particles shared (according to their IDs) between two snapshots for eight example trees constructed by following the ROCKSTAR descendant ID 'DescID' as a function of redshift. At first 90% of the particles are present in halos connected by their 'DescID' later the fraction drops rapidly. That leads to the conclusion that not the correction progenitors had be tracked. However, there is also the possibility that a mergering or stripping event happened.

  <figcaption>
    Redshift evolution and variation in the positions of the first 500 halos and their main progenitors appeared in the simulation. From this point of view the tracking of the progenitors seems correct.

  <figcaption>
        Redshift evolution and variation in the positions of the halo asigned the treeID=3 and their main progenitors. The variation in the position and location of the halo is reasonable.
