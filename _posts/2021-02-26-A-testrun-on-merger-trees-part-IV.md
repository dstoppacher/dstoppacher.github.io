<blockquote><tt><b>Summary:</b>Here we show the median variation of halo properties of main branch halos connected by the descendant information provided by a halo finder without running a tree builder on top of it. The median variations of the halo properties are shown within different uncertainty levels.</tt></blockquote>

This is the continuation of the post from <a href="https://dstoppacher.github.io/A-testrun-on-merger-trees-III/">2021-02-22</a>. Thereby we use only descendant information as the <tt>'DescID'</tt> provided directly by the halo finder <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ascl.soft10008B/abstract"><tt>Rockstar (RS)</tt></a>.
