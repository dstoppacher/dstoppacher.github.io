This is the continuation of the post from <a href="https://dstoppacher.github.io/A-testrun-on-merger-trees/">2021-01-07</a>. The following questions are still open will be discussed in this post.

<ol>
  <li>Verify the approach of connection halos by the provided <tt>haloid</tt> and <tt>descID</tt> by comparing directly with the numbers of particle assigned to the halos between snapshots.</li>

  <li>How does <b>ROCKSTAR</b> assign the <tt>descID</tt> when running?</li>

  <li>Calculate halo mass function and accretion rates.</li>
 </ol>
