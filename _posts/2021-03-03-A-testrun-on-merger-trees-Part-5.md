  <figcaption>Projection on X-Z axis of main branch of most massive halo. The red circles represent halos on the main branch if only ROCKSTAR's descendent IDs were used to build the main branch and the coloured dots the same information when Consistent-Trees was used to correct connections.

  <figcaption>Redshift evolution ofthe variation in the shared fraction of particle IDs in \% between two halos found by ROCKSTAR and connected by Consitent-Trees. The particle fractions are given in red (fraction of particle of the halo at certain snapshot $$SN_z$$ in comparision to the subsequent $$SN_{z+1}$$) and blue red (fraction of particle of the halo at certain snapshot $$SN_{z+1}$$ in comparision to the subsequent $$SN_z$$) of the halos on the main branch of rootIndex 79509.

  <figcaption>Same as in Fig.4 but here the halos were connected only by the descendent ID provided directly by ROCKSTSTAR and Connsitent-Trees was NOT run on top. Interestingly our results show less variations in the fraction of shared particle IDs and halo mass for the most massive halo with the treeID3.
