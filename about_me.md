PhD in Theoretical Astrophysics 2019 from the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM, Spain); currently a “Margarita Salas Fellow” and postdoctoral researcher in a joint project on: “Hidden Figures on the Sky”: Unveiling the formation and assembly channels of low surface brightness galaxies by studying them with various numerical models of galaxy formation and evolution; in collaboration with the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, the UAM, and the Universidad de Sevilla (Spain). Further past and ongoing projects including: “A semi-analytical perspective on … “; a series of studies and publications focusing on different aspects of galaxy formation and evolution using semi-analytical models (SAMs). She is further a peer-researcher on the “MultiDark-Galaxies” where she also provides support on the data release, analysis, and handling. Other interests including the galaxy-halo connection and the “assembly bias” of galaxy and halo formation or in other words: What does shape galaxy properties in the large-scale environment of the cosmic web? She is further a member of the movement “Astronomers for Planet Earth (A4E)”, the “Sociedad Española de Astronomía (SEA)”, and an advocate for student mental health awareness, cultural equity, and inclusion in Astrophysics.
